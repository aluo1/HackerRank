## Introduction
This is an easy question in [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-regex-patterns)

## Problem I met
- I didn't learn how to use Regular Expression in Java before, this is the main problem when I trying to solve this problem.
- Another problem is, I got no idea how to sort an ArrayList.

## How I solve this problem then
- I read the [provided tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-regex-patterns/tutorial) and found it is helpful to learn how to use Regular Expression in Java.
- After doing search, I found the thread in [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18441846/how-to-sort-an-arraylist-in-java) helps me a lot in understanding how to sort an ArrayList, thanks [TTT](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1427460/ttt) and [Marco](http://stackoverflow.com/users/921110/marco-johannesen)!

## What I learned from this question
- Learn how to use regular expression with the library `java.util.regex.*`
- Learn how to sort an ArrayList easily.

## Acknowledgement
- Thanks for [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) provides the spec of this problem and the Java skeleton.
