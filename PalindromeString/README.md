## Introduction
This is an easy question in [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-string-reverse)

## Problem I met
- I tried to iterate through the whole string, which make the solution more complex than expected.

## How I solve this problem then
- After seriously analysis the requirement and the feature of palindrome string, I found iterate through half of the string should be totally fine and reduce the complexity.


## Acknowledgement
- Thanks for [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) provides the spec of this problem and the Java skeleton.
