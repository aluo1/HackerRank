## Introduction
This is an easy question in [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-review-loop)

## Problem I met
- I was not familiar with Java before, therefore has no idea how to get the character at each index in Java, like `list[index]` in C/Python.
- Also, since I used to practice with many kinds of programming language, like C, Python, Ruby, Objective-C, etc. I am not sure if I can use String.length() to get the length of string in Java.
- What's more, I am not so sure if I can append character to another string directly in Java since in some programming language this kind of behaviour is not allowed.

## How I solve this problem then
- I googled the API of String, and find useful methods of String in [TutorialPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_strings.htm)
- I got some idea about string manipulation from [Damian Leszczy≈Ñski - Vashin in Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12899953/in-java-how-to-append-a-string-more-efficiently), thanks, Damian!

## Acknowledgement
- Thanks for [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) provides the spec of this problem and the Java skeleton.
